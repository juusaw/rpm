# rpm-app

A small webapp for calibrating a turntable using a mobile device gyroscope. Most recent mobile devices and browsers supported.

## Developing

The application is a very simple static web page that can be cloned and served locally with any HTTP server. Note that some clients require the application to be served over HTTPS to enable the Device Motion APIs.

## TODO

- Adjustable RPM target (currently hardcoded 33 1/3)
